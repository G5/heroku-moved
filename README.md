## What?

It's just a simple sinatra app that will run without any intervention on Heroku that will tell a visitor that an app has moved. Set the `MOVED_TO` environment variable on the app to the new domain (no protocol, just `whatever.yourdomain.com`). That's it.

## Why doesn't it-

Shhhhhh, it's fine. It doesn't redirect because I want people to realize it has moved, because eventually I plan to delete from heroku entirely. It's simple on purpose.
